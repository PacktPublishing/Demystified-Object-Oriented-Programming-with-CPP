// Chapter 3, Question 1, a - f. Sample Solution

// Modify and augment your C++ program from Chapter 2, Adding Language Necessities, Exercise 2 as follows:
// a. Create a function, ReadData(), which accepts a pointer to a Student as an argument to allow for 
// firstName, lastName, gpa, and the currentCourseEnrolled to be entered from the keyboard within the 
// function and stored as the input parameterâ€™s data.
// b. Modify firstName, lastName, and currentCourseEnrolled to be modelled as char * (or string) in your 
// Student class instead of using fixed sized arrays (as they may have been modelled in Chapter 2, Adding 
// Language Necessities). If using char *, you may utilize a temp variable which is a fixed size to initially 
// capture user input for these values, and then allocate the proper, respective sizes for each of these data members. 
// Note that using a string will be the simplest and safest approach. 
// c. Rewrite, if necessary, the Print() function from your solution in Chapter 2, Adding Language Necessities  
// to take a Student as a parameter for Print().
// d. Overload the Print() function with one which takes a const Student * as a parameter. Which one is 
// more efficient? Why?
// e. In main(), create an array of pointers to Student to accommodate 5 students. Allocate each Student, 
// call ReadData() for each Student and then Print() each Student using a selection from your above functions. 
// When done, remember to delete() the memory for each student allocated.
// f. Also in main(), create an array of void pointers which is the same size as the array of pointers to Student. 
// Set each element in the array of void pointers to point to a corresponding Student from the array of 
// Student pointers. Call the version of Print() which takes a const Student * as a parameter for each 
// element in the void * array. Hint: you will need to cast void * elements to type Student * prior to making 
// certain assignments and function calls.
