// Note: A const char * is used here for educational purposes (this is a chapter featuring pointers).
// Not to worry, we'll use a string whenever possible, but we're trying to illustrate a pointer concept right now.

   const char *newId1 = nullptr, *newId2 = nullptr;

   newId2 = GenId("Group");  // fn call will allocate memory 
   cout << "New ids: " << newId1 << " " << newId2 << endl;
   delete [] newId1;   // notice that we are deallocating in a different scope than we allocated.
   delete [] newId2;   // this will give us motivation later to use a smart pointer for safety.
                       // note: delete newId1; or delete newId2; would also be ok (primitive type)

   strcpy(temp, base);
   temp[strlen(base)] = suffix++;  // append suffix to base
   temp[strlen(base) + 1] = '\0';  // add null character
   return temp;   // temp will be up-cast to a const char * to be treated more
